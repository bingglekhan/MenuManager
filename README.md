### Features

- the main menu is dynamically generated by the Back-End for the UI
- allow for the easy management of the main (sidebar) menus of the application
- permits the creation, update, delete, reordering of the menus
- comes with a VueJS component that offers the capability to reorder menus through drag-and-drop
- offers the functionality to automatically generate breadcrumbs based on the current route

### Under the Hood

- a menu element may have several roles attached and is rendered only for the users with the respective roles
- menu element attributes:
  - `parent_id`: the id of its parent menu, if he has a parent, or null
  - `name`: the label that is translated and visible in the UI
  - `icon`: the icon classes, visible in the UI
  - `order`: is used for ordering the elements of the menu and is automatically generated when reordering the menu from the UI 
  - `link`: is the link that's going to be accessed when clicking on the menu
  - `has_children`: is a flag telling us if a menu element has children and is used when rendering the menu. When reordering the menu the `has_children` flag is automatically set as needed

### Publishes

- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=menus-component` - the VueJS component
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-update` - a common alias for when wanting to update the VueJS component, 
once a newer version is released
